# Design Document: Bingo Web App

## Overview

The Bingo Web App is a real-time, mobile-first web application that enables up to 100 concurrent players to participate in bingo games managed by 1-2 administrators. The system is designed to provide a seamless, low-friction experience with real-time updates, automatic reconnection, and intuitive interfaces for both players and administrators.

This document outlines the technical design of the application, including architecture, components, data models, and implementation strategies to meet the requirements specified in the requirements document.

## Architecture

The application follows a client-server architecture with real-time communication capabilities:

  code: string;                // Short code for joining
  status: GameStatus;          // 'created', 'active', 'paused', 'ended'
  createdAt: Date;             // Creation timestamp
  startedAt?: Date;            // Game start timestamp
  endedAt?: Date;              // Game end timestamp
  expiresAt: Date;             // TTL for DynamoDB (max 12 hours)
  drawMode: DrawMode;          // 'manual' or 'timed'
  drawInterval?: number;       // Interval in seconds for timed mode
  drawnNumbers: number[];      // Numbers that have been called
  lastDrawnAt?: Date;          // Timestamp of last number draw
  playerCount: number;         // Number of registered players
  activePlayerCount: number;   // Number of currently connected players
  bingoCount: number;          // Number of players who have reached bingo
  adminConnections: string[];  // Admin connection IDs
}

enum GameStatus {
  CREATED = 'created',
  ACTIVE = 'active',
  PAUSED = 'paused',
  ENDED = 'ended'
}

enum DrawMode {
  MANUAL = 'manual',
  TIMED = 'timed'
}
```

### Player

```typescript
interface Player {
  id: string;                  // Unique identifier
  gameId: string;              // Reference to game
  name: string;                // Player name

}
```

### WebSocket Messages

```typescript
interface WebSocketMessage {
  type: MessageType;
  payload: any;
  timestamp: Date;
}

enum MessageType {
  // Game state messages
  GAME_STATE_UPDATE = 'game_state_update',
  NUMBER_DRAWN = 'number_drawn',
  GAME_PAUSED = 'game_paused',
  GAME_RESUMED = 'game_resumed',
  GAME_ENDED = 'game_ended',
  
  // Player messages
  PLAYER_JOINED = 'player_joined',
  PLAYER_LEFT = 'player_left',
  PLAYER_STATUS_CHANGE = 'player_status_change',
  PLAYER_PUNCHED_NUMBER = 'player_punched_number',
  PLAYER_UNPUNCHED_NUMBER = 'player_unpunched_number',
  PLAYER_BINGO = 'player_bingo',
  
  // Connection messages
  CONNECT = 'connect',
  DISCONNECT = 'disconnect',
  RECONNECT = 'reconnect',

  // Error messages
  ERROR = 'error'
}
```

## Error Handling
