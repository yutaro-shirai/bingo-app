## Introduction

The Bingo Web App is a mobile-first, installation-free web application designed to facilitate bingo games for up to 100 concurrent players, managed by 1-2 administrators in real-time. The application aims to provide a seamless bingo experience with minimal friction for both players and administrators, featuring real-time updates, automatic reconnection, and intuitive interfaces for game management.

## Requirements

3. WHEN a player enters a valid game code manually THEN the system SHALL add them to the corresponding game room.
4. WHEN a player joins a game THEN the system SHALL generate and display a unique 5Ã—5 bingo card.
5. WHEN a player joins a game in progress THEN the system SHALL show the current state of the game including previously called numbers.

### Requirement 2: Bingo Card Interaction

**User Story:** As a player, I want to interact with my bingo card by tapping numbers, so that I can mark called numbers easily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player taps a number on their card THEN the system SHALL visually mark that number as punched.
2. WHEN a player taps a punched number THEN the system SHALL remove the punch mark.
3. WHEN a number is called by the administrator THEN the system SHALL highlight that number on all players' cards within 1 second.
4. WHEN a player has a row, column, or diagonal of punched numbers THEN the system SHALL indicate they have reached "bingo" status.
5. WHEN a player's device loses connection THEN the system SHALL preserve their card state.
6. WHEN a player's device reconnects THEN the system SHALL restore their card state and synchronize with the current game state.

### Requirement 3: Game Administration

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to create and manage bingo games, so that I can run organized sessions for players.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator creates a new game THEN the system SHALL generate a unique game code and QR code.
2. WHEN an administrator starts a game THEN the system SHALL activate the game room for up to 12 hours.
3. WHEN an administrator pauses a game THEN the system SHALL temporarily halt number calling.
4. WHEN an administrator ends a game THEN the system SHALL close the room and notify all participants.
5. WHEN an administrator selects manual number drawing THEN the system SHALL allow them to draw numbers at their own pace.
6. WHEN an administrator selects timed number drawing THEN the system SHALL automatically draw numbers at the specified interval.
7. WHEN a game is active THEN the system SHALL display previously called numbers to all participants.

### Requirement 4: Real-time Monitoring

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to monitor game progress and player status in real-time, so that I can manage the game effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player reaches "bingo" status THEN the system SHALL notify the administrator immediately.
2. WHEN a player joins or leaves a game THEN the system SHALL update the participant list in real-time.
3. WHEN a player's connection status changes THEN the system SHALL update their online status in the administrator view.
4. WHEN an administrator views the game dashboard THEN the system SHALL display statistics on how many players are close to bingo.
5. WHEN multiple players claim bingo simultaneously THEN the system SHALL list them in chronological order.

### Requirement 5: Connection Reliability

**User Story:** As a user (player or administrator), I want stable connection handling, so that temporary network issues don't disrupt the game experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user's device loses connection THEN the system SHALL attempt to reconnect automatically.
2. WHEN a user's device reconnects THEN the system SHALL synchronize their state with the current game state.
3. WHEN a user's device remains disconnected for more than 5 minutes THEN the system SHALL mark them as offline but preserve their game state.
4. WHEN an administrator's device loses connection THEN the system SHALL continue the game according to the last active settings.
5. WHEN a game has no active administrator for more than 30 minutes THEN the system SHALL pause the game automatically.

### Requirement 6: Mobile-First Experience

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want a responsive and intuitive interface, so that I can play bingo comfortably on my device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

4. WHEN a user views their bingo card on a mobile device THEN the system SHALL ensure all numbers are legible and tappable.
5. WHEN a user receives notifications THEN the system SHALL display them in a non-intrusive manner.

### Requirement 7: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to handle up to 100 concurrent users with minimal latency, so that large groups can play together smoothly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN 100 users are connected simultaneously THEN the system SHALL maintain response times under 1 second for all critical operations.
2. WHEN a number is called THEN the system SHALL propagate this information to all clients within 1 second.
3. WHEN multiple users perform actions simultaneously THEN the system SHALL process these actions without degradation in performance.
4. WHEN the system approaches resource limits THEN the system SHALL implement graceful degradation strategies.
5. WHEN a game room is inactive for more than 12 hours THEN the system SHALL automatically clean up resources.
